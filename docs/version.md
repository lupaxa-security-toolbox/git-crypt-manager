# Project Version

Current version: `1.0.0`

This version number reflects the current active development state of the project.
Releases follow a structured versioning flow based on **semantic versioning**,
where changes to the major, minor, or patch numbers represent different levels
of compatibility and stability. Pre-release stages such as `-devN` or `-rcN`
indicate ongoing work prior to a final stable release.

Version information is automatically managed using the project’s
*Makefile* and *bump-my-version* workflow. This ensures consistent tagging
and reduces the risk of manual versioning mistakes. Developers can refer to the
"Versioning" section of the Developer Guide for instructions on how to
bump versions, move between development and release cycles, and publish
new releases.
